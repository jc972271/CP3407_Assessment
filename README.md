# Development Tools used

Throughout our project, we demonstrated use of modern software development tools and building platforms to streamline 
our workflow and improve overall quality. For website development, we used Bubble, a no-code visual development 
platform that allowed us to rapidly build and deploy fully functional pages. Bubble enabled us to focus on design and 
functionality without being limited by traditional coding constraints, while still supporting complex logic and backend 
workflows.

For designing and planning the user interface, we used Figma, a collaborative design tool that helped us prototype most
of our user stories. Figma was instrumental in mapping out page flows, refining UI components, and ensuring design 
consistency across all screens. It also allowed for easy communication within the team, as everyone could view and 
comment on designs in real-time.

# Communication Tools used

For communication and collaboration, we used Discord as our main platform. It allowed us to stay connected and 
organized throughout the project. We held weekly voice call meetings to plan upcoming tasks, review completed work, and 
reflect on any challenges, closely following the structure of Agile sprint planning and retrospectives. In addition, we 
had daily text check-ins, similar to Agile stand-ups, where each team member provided short updates on what they had 
done, what they were working on next, and any blockers they encountered. This consistent, iterative communication 
helped us stay flexible, respond quickly to changes, and continuously improve our workflow, all in line with Agile 
principles.
