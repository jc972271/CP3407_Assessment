## Architectural Design 


## Database Design 
! [User Registration UI](Images/data-flow-diagram.png)
We decided to use three databases: one for users, one for service providers, and one
for bookings.

## Interface Design 
! [User Registration UI prototype](../Images/login_ui_1.png)
The login page was designed with a blue, grey and white colour scheme, accompanied by
an image with similar colours. The input fields are in proximity with each-other to
make it very easy to sign-up or sign-in. The design follows the standards and conventions
of most sign-in/sign-up pages. The fields change depending if the user has an account or
not by clicking on the link at the bottom. Everything else on the page remains to maintain
consistency.

! [Search page prototype](../Images/search_ui_1.png)
The search page was designed to have very simple functionality with easy to use filters
and a clean display. The search bar is situated at the top and immediately draws the eye
so the user can very quickly find what they want. Filters help users narrow their 
search down even more easily, giving them more control and customisation.
