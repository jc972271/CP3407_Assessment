## Architectural Design 


## Database Design 
! [User Registration UI](Images/data-flow-diagram.png)
We decided to use three databases: one for users, one for service providers, and one
for bookings.

## Interface Design 
! [User Registration UI](../Images/login_ui_2.png)
The login page was designed with a blue, grey and white colour scheme, accompanied by
an image with similar colours. The input fields are in proximity with each-other to
make it very easy to sign-up or sign-in. The design follows the standards and conventions
of most sign-in/sign-up pages. The fields change depending if the user has an account or
not by clicking on the link at the bottom. Everything else on the page remains to maintain
consistency.
