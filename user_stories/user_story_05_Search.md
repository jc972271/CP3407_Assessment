# Testing

## Developer Testing:
To test the search function multiple cleaning companies were added with different details then we 
tested each filter and the search bar ensuring only the expected cleaning companies showed up.
The search bar can be used to search for a specific company or a specific keyword.

The filters can be used to help narrow down the search, and the testing showed that the
filters work correctly.

## User Testing:
The user was able to easily search for different cleaning companies using the search bar
and filters.
