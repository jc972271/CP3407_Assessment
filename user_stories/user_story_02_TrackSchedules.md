3. Integrate UI with backend data, 0.5 days


# UI Design:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Many user stories are connected to a User interface.
* Insert a mockup design screenshot using any prototyping tools, e.g. [https://ninjamock.com/](https://ninjamock.com/)

# Completed:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Insert screenshots of completed. 
* If you have multiple versions (changes between iteractions), show them all.

## Developer Testing
The testing account was used to view the bookings schedule to ensure it functions correctly.
When the user goes to the manage bookings page, they can view their bookings and a summary of relevant details
for easy viewing.

This is based off the same test data for the create bookings user story.
In future iterations, calendar integration would be included.
